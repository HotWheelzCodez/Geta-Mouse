# Geta-Rat
This is a game made in just under a week for a ELA project (This is not a 100% finished or polished game, I may or may not continue working on it), we had to pick a time era, the 20's or 30's and I choose the 30's, there was also a corresponding book for each time, mine was, "Of Mice and Men". Thus the game is based off of the book including facts from the 30's the game starts with a whack-a-mole type game, with mice where your hand is Lennie and since in the book he accedintly kills several things, you end up killing the mice in the game. How ever if you do not collect enough of the mice then the pick bunny rabbit will come for you and shot with a shotgun; if you do collect enough mice then you move onto the next stage of the game. The next stage is a boss fight against Curly's wife, in the book Lennie strangled her to death, therefor that is what you will do, you have to press the correct key that pops up to shake her to death. If you did not shake her enough then George will come over, yell at you, and then shoot from behind. However if you do shake her enough, then you make it to the final stage, where if you collected 70 mice then you will be able to escape the dust storm and win, however if you did not then the dust storm will come and get you.

## Installation
Make sure you have CMake installed (I don't think it fully on Windows, you will most likely have to change the cmakelists.txt file to work for windows)

Other than that all you have to do is run the run.sh file
```bash
bash run.sh
```
